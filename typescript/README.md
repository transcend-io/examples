## Transcend-internal developer notes

-  This code is actively used for live demos.
-  This is associated with the demo account, [eShopIt](https://e-shop-it.trsnd.co).
-  It is hosted on [Render](http://render.com/) at <https://transcend-example.onrender.com>.
-  A design choice was made not to put webhook verification on an Express middleware. It's a nice refactor, but it can be esoteric to readers.
-  Use ngrok in dev.
